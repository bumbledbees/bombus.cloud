## what is this?

a work in progress. it uses [lucid](https://chrisdone.com/posts/lucid/) and
[clay](http://fvisser.nl/clay/), which are Haskell EDSLs for HTML and CSS
respectively, to generate static files for [my website](https://bombus.cloud).

it's really janky in its current state but it works for now! feedback for how
this could be improved is always greatly appreciated though! :)
